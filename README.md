# EVM-WITH-ARDUINO
An Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a device used to record votes electronically. This project uses Arduino Uno R3 to create an EVM with voting options, a NOTA feature, vote clearing, and result display. LEDs indicate vote acceptance and results, ensuring a simple and efficient voting process.
